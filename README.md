The aim of the project is to acquire EMG signals from the human body in real-time and display the contraction times, the amplitude of the contraction. The EMG signals obtained through the electrodes and leads are preprocessed in a circuit that includes an instrumentation amplifier (AD620), a capacitor for linearization, notch filter, active low-pass, and active high-pass filter. After pre-processing, these signals are transmitted to the analog-to-digital converter, which communicates with the computer via the USB cable. In the software, these signals can be monitored in real-time with FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). The software also offers IIR filtering types such as Butterworth, Chebyshev, and elliptic that can be applied to these signals in real-time. Real-time signals can be recorded at the desired time interval for post-processing. The last process involves calculating the contraction times and the contraction amplitude by taking the RMS (Root Mean Square) of the real-time signal.
